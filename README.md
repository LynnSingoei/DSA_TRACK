# DSA_TRACK
Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – Complete Beginner-to-Expert Guide

Welcome to the ultimate Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) roadmap created for beginners, students, and anyone who wants to master problem-solving and technical interview skills.

This repository is divided into two major sections:

📘 Theory (Concepts + Notes + Code Examples)

🧠 Practice (Pattern-based problems + LeetCode solutions)

Every topic is structured to take you from zero → hero, with clear explanations, diagrams, implementation examples, and recommended exercises.

Goals of This Repository

By following this roadmap, you will:

✔ Understand every major data structure and algorithm
✔ Code them from scratch in your language of choice
✔ Learn complexity analysis (Big-O) deeply
✔ Master the core patterns required for coding interviews
✔ Build real mini-projects to reinforce every concept
✔ Prepare confidently for FAANG-level interviews

THE THEORY SECTION

Each topic folder contains:

Overview / Real-life analogy

Why this matters

Operations & Time complexities

Visual diagrams

Multiple implementations (Python/Java/C++)

Mini-project / assignment
