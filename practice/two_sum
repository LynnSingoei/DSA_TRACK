# Two Sum

LeetCode Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
Each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Intuition:
The simplest approach is to check all possible pairs to see if their sum equals the target → brute force.
- Problem: This takes O(n^2) time, inefficient for large arrays.

Better approach: Keep track of numbers we have already seen in a hash map and check if the complement (target - current number) exists → optimized hash map.

Step-by-step Example:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
seen = {}

Step 1: num=2 → complement=7 → 7 not in seen → add 2 to seen → seen={2:0}
Step 2: num=7 → complement=2 → 2 is in seen → found the pair → return indices [0,1]

Approach 1: Brute Force (Step-by-step)
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Step 1: i=0, j=1 → nums[0]+nums[1]=2+7=9 → matches target → return [0,1]
Step 2: (not needed, already returned)

Code:
def two_sum_bruteforce(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                return [i, j]
    return []

print(two_sum_bruteforce([2,7,11,15], 9))  # Output: [0,1]

Complexity:
Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(1)

---

Approach 2: Optimized (Hash Map) – Step-by-step
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
seen = {}

Step 1: num=2 → complement=7 → 7 not in seen → add 2 to seen → seen={2:0}
Step 2: num=7 → complement=2 → 2 is in seen → found the pair → return indices [0,1]
Step 3: num=11 → not reached
Step 4: num=15 → not reached

Code:
def two_sum_optimized(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []

print(two_sum_optimized([2,7,11,15], 9))  # Output: [0,1]

Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

Pattern:
Type: Arrays + Hashing
Template: Walk through array → check complement in hash map → add current number to hash map
When to use: If you need to find pairs in an array efficiently
